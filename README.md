#Create a Portfolio Project

##I will be honest. I tried really hard on this, but there are just so many concepts here that make zero sense to me. 
I plan on updating this and making it look "professional" once some of these things begin to click and make sense.
Unfortunately that is not at this time. While I tried to resemble to mock-up in some ways, it is painfully clear that 
I was unable to figure out what exactly to do in some areas.

##I attempted to do hover animations, but after hours of unsuccessful attempts of moving things around, trying different 
properties, and trying to figure out what the hell I was doing wrong through the internet, I am going with just simple
color changes via hovering.

##Nesting was something else I had trouble with. I could not get the section titles to look as I wanted them to look. 
this became especially apparent during the media queries and my attempts to redistribute them. I'm frustrated that I
was unable to figure them out as it seems like there is a simple fix for this that is just beyond my grasp. Specifically,
I wanted them to hang centered above their sections for the smaller screened counterparts. I feel that I was able to resize
the grid, the header, and the about me sections to fit smaller screens, but the footer is not well done. Again I spent way
too much time attempting to figure this out with zero positive results.

##Lastly I will address the few to little amounts of commits. I was really discouraged by this project and found myself just 
trying to get stuff onto the screen. I neglected to commit at more appropriate times, and I will do better with this going forward.

## Not sure what else to say, I'm not happy with what I am putting forward here, but I have run out of ideas as to how to make it better.
